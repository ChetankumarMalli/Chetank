This repository contains files from a ServiceNow custom application Called "Public Service Template."  The purpose of the application is to collect ServiceNow configurations that will remove the complexity of deploying a Public Service Catalog in ServiceNow.  In dismissing the complexity, we also expect to see a significant reduction in the time it takes to deploy public-facing Service channels to interact with Residents, Customers, Students, etc..,
